CODE PLAN
Here's a high-level plan for creating a React-based calculator with Node.js as the backend:

**Frontend (React)**

* Create a new React project using `create-react-app`
* Design and implement the calculator interface using React components:
	+ Implement a grid system to display numbers, operators, and equals signs
	+ Use React Hooks to manage state and handle user input (e.g., pressing buttons)
	+ Implement functionality for calculating expressions (e.g., parsing math expressions, evaluating results)
* Use React's built-in support for CSS styling to create a visually appealing design

**Backend (Node.js)**

* Create a new Node.js project using a framework like Express.js or Koa.js
* Design and implement API endpoints to handle calculator requests:
	+ `/calculate`: accepts math expressions as input, evaluates the expression using a library like `math-expression-evaluator`, and returns the result
	+ `/clear`: resets the calculator's internal state (e.g., clears displayed result)
	+ `/get-state`: returns the current calculator state (e.g., the displayed result)
* Implement API endpoints for handling user input events:
	+ `/key-press`: accepts a key press event (e.g., button click), updates the calculator's internal state accordingly
	+ `/expression-change`: accepts an updated math expression, re-evaluates it if necessary

**Server Setup**

* Set up a web server to host the React application using a package like `http-server` or `live-server`
* Configure the Node.js backend to listen on port 6969 (as per your request)
* Implement basic error handling and logging mechanisms for debugging purposes

**Deployment**

* Deploy the frontend React app to a hosting platform like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages
* Expose the Node.js backend API endpoints using a reverse proxy or a load balancer like NGINX or HAProxy
* Ensure the web server is configured correctly and listening on port 6969

This plan should provide a solid foundation for building a React-based calculator with a Node.js backend.

### Installing and Setting up the Calculator
Before you start using the calculator, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

* Node.js (version 14 or higher)
* npm package manager
* yarn package manager
* Your preferred code editor or IDE

To set up the calculator, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```
cd calculator
npm install
```
3. Build and serve the React application:
```
npm run build
npm start
```
4. Start the Node.js server:
```
node app.js
```

### Running the Calculator

Once you've set up the calculator, you can interact with it using a web browser.

* Open your favorite web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:6969`
* You'll see a simple calculator interface with buttons for digits 0-9 and basic arithmetic operations (+,-,\*)
* Type in an expression or use the buttons to build one
* When you press the "Calculate" button, the result will be displayed below the input field

### Notes and Troubleshooting

* The calculator uses the `math-expression-eval` library to evaluate mathematical expressions. If you encounter any issues with expression evaluation, feel free to reach out to me for help.
* Make sure your Node.js server is running before attempting to use the calculator.

### Used Files

Here's a list of all used files and their descriptions:

**Frontend Files**

1. `calculator-app/ src/App.js`: Main React component that renders the calculator interface
2. `calculator-app/ src/Components/Button.js`: Button component for digits 0-9 and arithmetic operations (+,-,\*)
3. `calculator-app/ src/Components/InputField.js`: Input field component for user input expressions
4. `calculator-utils.js`: Utility file that provides functions for calculating expressions

**Backend Files**

1. `app.js`: Node.js server file that sets up API endpoints for calculating expressions and resetting the calculator's state
2. `calculator-utils.js`: Utility file that provides functions for evaluating mathematical expressions

### Used Packages

Here's a list of all used packages:

* `math-expression-eval`: Library for evaluating mathematical expressions
* `react`: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* `react-dom`: React DOM library for rendering components to the DOM
* `express`: Node.js web framework for setting up API endpoints
* `body-parser`: Express middleware for parsing JSON requests
