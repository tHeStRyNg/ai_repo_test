### Installing and Setting up the Calculator
Before you start using the calculator, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

* Node.js (version 14 or higher)
* npm package manager
* yarn package manager
* Your preferred code editor or IDE

To set up the calculator, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```
cd calculator
npm install
```
3. Build and serve the React application:
```
npm run build
npm start
```
4. Start the Node.js server:
```
node app.js
```

### Running the Calculator

Once you've set up the calculator, you can interact with it using a web browser.

* Open your favorite web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:6969`
* You'll see a simple calculator interface with buttons for digits 0-9 and basic arithmetic operations (+,-,\*)
* Type in an expression or use the buttons to build one
* When you press the "Calculate" button, the result will be displayed below the input field

### Notes and Troubleshooting

* The calculator uses the `math-expression-eval` library to evaluate mathematical expressions. If you encounter any issues with expression evaluation, feel free to reach out to me for help.
* Make sure your Node.js server is running before attempting to use the calculator.
